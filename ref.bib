@article{triazines,
	Abstract = {A common step in pharmaceutical development is the formation of a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) to model an exploratory series of compounds. A QSAR generalizes how the structure (shape) of a compound relates to its biological activity. A comparative study was carried out of six artificial intelligence and traditional algorithms for modeling QSAR's: GOLEM, CART, and M5 from symbolic machine learning; back-propagation from neural networks; and linear regression and nearest-neighbor from traditional statistics. Two test case problems were studied: the inhibition of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) by pyrimidines, and the inhibition of rat/mouse tumor DHFR by triazines. It was found that there was no significant statistical difference between the methods in terms of their ability to rank unseen compounds by activity. However, symbolic machine learning methods, in particular relational ones, were found to generate rules that provided insight into the stereo-chemistry of compound receptor interactions.},

  abstract="Feature selection is a preprocessing phase to machine learning, which leads to increase the classification accuracy and reduce its complexity. However, the increase of data dimensionality poses a challenge to many existing feature selection methods. This paper formulates and validates a method for selecting optimal feature subset based on the analysis of the Pearson correlation coefficients. We adopt the correlation analysis between two variables as a feature goodness measure. Where, a feature is good if it is highly correlated to the class and is low correlated to the other features. To evaluate the proposed Feature selection method, experiments are applied on NSL-KDD dataset. The experiments shows that, the number of features is reduced from 41 to 17 features, which leads to improve the classification accuracy to 99.1{\%}. Also, The efficiency of the proposed linear correlation feature selection method is demonstrated through extensive comparisons with other well known feature selection methods.",

The models include linear regression, two-class logistic regression, and multi- nomial regression problems while the penalties include ℓ1 (the lasso), ℓ2 (ridge regression) and mixtures of the two (the elastic net). The algorithms use cyclical coordinate descent, computed along a regularization path. The methods can handle large problems and can also deal efficiently with sparse features. In comparative timings we find that the new algorithms are considerably faster than competing methods.},

  abstract="U.S. public opinion regarding climate change has become increasingly polarized in recent years, as partisan think tanks and others worked to recast an originally scientific topic into a political wedge issue. Nominally ``scientific'' arguments against taking anthropogenic climate change seriously have been publicized to reach informed but ideologically receptive audiences. Reflecting the success of such arguments, polls have noted that concern about climate change increased with education among Democrats, but decreased with education among Republicans. These observations lead to the hypothesis that there exist interaction (non-additive) effects between education or knowledge and political orientation, net of other background factors, in predicting public concern about climate change. Two regional telephone surveys, conducted in New Hampshire (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}541) and Michigan (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}1, 008) in 2008, included identical climate-change questions that provide opportunities to test this hypothesis. Multivariate analysis of both surveys finds significant interactions. These empirical results fit with theoretical interpretations and several other recent studies. They suggest that the classically identified social bases of concern about the environment in general, and climate in particular, have shifted in recent years. Narrowcast media, including the many Web sites devoted to discrediting climate-change concerns, provide ideal conduits for channeling contrarian arguments to an audience predisposed to believe and electronically spread them further. Active-response Web sites by climate scientists could prove critical to counterbalancing contrarian arguments.",
